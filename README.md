# basic_projects
In this repository, I will use Machine Learning algorithms to perform some projects based on real life problems.
## (a) Predict House Price

## (b) Analyzing Sentiment 
In this notebook, we have analyzed the sentiment of real product reviews and predicted a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...)(classification)
