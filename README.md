In this repository, I will use Machine Learning algorithms to perform some projects based on real life problems.
## (a) Predict House Price 
In this notebook, we have showed how to predict house price using different attributes ( building a regression model).
## (b) Analyzing Sentiment 
In this notebook, we have analyzed the sentiment of real product reviews and predicted a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...)(classification)
## (c) Retrive data
We built an intelligent document retrieval system for Wikipedia entries in this notebook.
## (d) building recommendation system
Motivation : Ever wonder how Amazon forms its personalized product recommendations? How Netflix suggests movies to watch? How Pandora selects the next song to stream? How Facebook or LinkedIn finds people you might connect with? Underlying all of these technologies for personalized content is something called collaborative filtering.
We will show how to build such a recommender system using a variety of techniques, and explore their tradeoffs.One method we examine is matrix factorization, which learns features of users and products to form recommendations. In this Jupyter notebook, we will use these techniques to build a real song recommender system.
